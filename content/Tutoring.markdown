The UNC CS Club runs a tutoring program, Thursdays from 5:00 to 7:00 in FB 007.
Here, older CS Majors tutor COMP 110 in their assignments or
answer any questions they may have. If you are stuck on a particular
assignment, need help studying for an upcoming exam, or just want to hang out,
drop by! If you want to become a tutor, email [Ryan Oberfelder](/People#oberfeld), [Forrest Li](/People#fcli)
or [ Brandon Davis](/People#bd) to get started!

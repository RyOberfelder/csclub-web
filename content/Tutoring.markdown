The UNC ACM runs a tutoring program, Thursdays from 5:00 to 7:00 in FB 007.
Here, older CS Majors tutor COMP 110 and 401 students in their assignments or
answer any questions they may have. If you want to become a tutor, email
[Matthew Leming](/people#mleming) or [Rahul Ramkumar](/people#rramkuma). We prefer
tutors who have already
taken 401 and are now in 410, at least, but this is flexible.

The UNC CS Club runs a tutoring program, Thursdays from 5:00 to 7:00 in FB 007.
Here, older CS Majors tutor COMP 110 and 401 students in their assignments or
answer any questions they may have. If you are stuck on a particular
assignment, need help studying for an upcoming exam, or just want to hang out,
drop by! If you want to become a tutor, email [Matthew Leming](/people#mleming)
or [Rahul Ramkumar](/people#rramkuma) to get started!

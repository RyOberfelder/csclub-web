Title: Hackerspace
---

The Hackerspace at Chapel Hill, usually referred to as HatCH, meets every
Thursday at 7:30 in Sitterson 027. Members of HatCH are inspired to create a
friendly and open community of students interested in participating in various
DIY projects involving electronics and art. Come to our weekly gatherings to
learn about technology, collaborate on technical ventures, work on individual
projects, or just relax and enjoy the company of our HatCHlings! Contact [Roman Myers](/People#rbmyers) or [Chelsea Bartram](/People#cbartram) for further
inquiries about how awesome we are.

The below examples show some extra features in the CSS which aren't actually
being used right now; they may be handy later:

### Ex Ample --- Title <example@example.com> {#example}
<alternate-email@example.com>\\
(202) 555-5555
{:.moreinfo}
[website](http://example.com)
{:.moreinfo}
This is a placeholder person, so while development goes on we can keep track of
how to do moreinfo and the like, and also what it looks like. A cool guy.
There's a lot of info here about him for testing purposes; you see, we need to
see how more info interacts on the right. And so we will continue writing until
we clear the float on the right, which might take a while.

This is a second paragraph on the example person. How droll.

#### Ex Ample II --- Has-No-Description <exampleII@example.com> {#example2}

#### Ex Ample III --- Has-No-Description <example3@example.com> {#example3}

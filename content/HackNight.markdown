Title: Hack Night
---

Hack Nights are weekly events where a group of us gets together, occasionally
gets fueled by sugary things, and work on software projects beyond the limited
imagination of class. We've had brief encounters with Node.js, Dart,
Javascript, and Git. Come with a project or we'll provide something to occupy
your time, and subsequently distract you from accomplishing anything anyway.
All in good fun. Hope to see you there. Contact [Katie Hawthorne](/people#kathryne) with
questions or baked good suggestions.

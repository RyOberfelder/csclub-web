Candidates were scored in four areas.  Forty points were allocated to the 
platform for its focus on technology (10), issues (15), and feasibility (15).  
The other sixty points were given based on presentation during the debate.



=== MONIQUE HARDIN                     t[ 5]  i[10]  f[12]  p[38]  =  total[65]

    Monique, we found the depth of your tech platform points to be excellent -- 
    it's extremely admirable that you've discussed your platform points with 
    stakeholders and wrote a clear plan about making them a reality.  We are, 
    however, concerned that you did not mention some extremely important tech 
    issues facing campus in 2010-2011, specifically ConnectCarolina; and would 
    prefer the breadth of your platform to be a bit greater. 

    If you're elected, we'd really like to see you work to gain information 
    about ConnectCarolina and student email outsourcing.  Some good people to 
    talk to are in the current Student Government, Tim McGuire, or Larry 
    Conrad.



=== NASH KEUNE                         t[ 0]  i[ 1]  f[ 0]  p[ 8]  =  total[ 9]

    Nash, we find your mention of printer money allotment interesting.



=== JOE LEVIN-MANNING                  t[ 7]  i[12]  f[ 7]  p[34]  =  total[60]

    Joe, we find that you have very many technology-related ideas, many of 
    which are novel and interesting; which we like.  However, we find that you 
    do not specify how to complete any of your points, and we're not convinced 
    of the feasibility of all of them.  The platform points were also hard to 
    find due to a lack of platform organization. 

    If you're elected, we'd like to see you flesh out your tech policy ideas 
    very early in your tenure so that they can best be completed.  It might 
    also be useful for you to meet with stakeholders in tech policy on campus 
    so that you get a better sense of who is responsible for what.



=== HOGAN MEDLIN                       t[ 8]  i[13]  f[10]  p[47]  =  total[78]

    Hogan, your platform is by far the most detailed and knowledgeable about 
    our current tech policy.  We like that you hit the three major tech topics 
    that we feel like the campus will be facing in 2010-2011 (ConnectCarolina, 
    student email, and CCI Printing), as well as many others.  However, we also 
    feel that the platform is a bit lacking in new, original, exciting tech 
    ideas you can bring to Carolina, and we feel that you could have worked 
    through more of some of the points and have already talked to stakeholders 
    about some of the more major points.  Overall, though, it is a solid 
    platform which has our highest total score.

    If you're elected, we'd like to see you or a key player in your cabinet 
    meet with stakeholders in tech policy on campus very early in your tenure.  
    We'd also like to see you take a look at your opponents' campaigns for some 
    of their innovative tech ideas.



=== SHRUTI SHAH                        t[ 6]  i[10]  f[10]  p[47]  =  total[73]

    Shruti, you have a decent, no-nonsense tech platform.  While we find it not 
    as holistic as we'd like to see and in general just a continuation of old 
    policies, we are glad that you mentioned ConnectCarolina and think that 
    your database and podcast ideas are interesting.  We are particularly happy 
    to see that you separated the positions of Tech and Web committee and 
    Student Government webmaster, and understand the importance of having 
    permanent positions of both (instead of making a "Tech liaison" position). 

    If you're elected, we'd like to see you flesh out the details of your tech 
    platform and make sure to keep room for healthy, new tech initiatives as 
    they come up.  It would also be good for you to learn about student email 
    outsourcing either from someone in the current Student Government, Tim 
    McGuire, or Larry Conrad.



=== GREG STROMPOLOS                    t[10]  i[10]  f[ 5]  p[30]  =  total[55]

    Greg, we are very gratified that you place technological issues of the 
    highest importance in your platform.  We particularly think your 
    Teacher-Course Rating System is very interesting and exciting.  While we 
    are also glad you recognized the importance of student email outsourcing, 
    we're concerned that the wording of your first platform point stance means 
    you haven't seriously considered all student email alternatives and made an 
    informed decision on what provider would be the best for campus.  We are 
    also concerned that your plan for "getting it done" in generally consists 
    of you saying "I'll do what it takes" and you may not have fully thought 
    out or contacted the stakeholders about these issues, especially 
    considering these are the primary points of your whole platform. 

    If you're elected, we would like to see you talk to some people involved in 
    tech policy in the current government as well as Larry Conrad and Brian 
    Payst.
